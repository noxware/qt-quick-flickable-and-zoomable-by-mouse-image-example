# Qt-Quick-Flickable-And-Zoomable-By-Mouse-Image-Example

This is a simple example of how to do... what the title says... maybe...

## What it does
  - It shows an image of your choice
  - The image is easily adjusted to the window size
  - You can zoom the image
  - You can move using your mouse through the zoomed image

> **NOTE:** This example only works using a mouse, it is not for touch devices.

## Code notes

The code...

- Is very short and readable
- Is a good QML example
- Only uses a signal handler for handling the mouse wheel event (everything else is done automatically by property bindings)
- Shows you how powerful property bindings are
